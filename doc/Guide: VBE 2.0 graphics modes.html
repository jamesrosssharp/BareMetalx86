<p>There is one major problem with the VESA standard. It was designed
several years ago while people were still using 286 machines, so it is
a real mode API with a 16 bit interface. You can still use it from a
32 bit protected mode system like djgpp, but this means that every
time you call a VESA function the cpu has to switch into real mode in
order to run the 16 bit driver code, and then it has to switch back
into protected mode before it can return to your program. These mode
switches are slow, and can be a real performance problem because you
will often need to switch banks many hundred times while drawing a
complex image. The VBE 2.0 API is a more recent extension to the
original standard, and adds some features designed to improve the
performance of protected mode programs.</p>

<p> Not every machine will have a VBE 2.0 driver installed. This can
be detected by checking that the high byte of the
<tt>vesa_info.VESAVersion</tt> field contains a value greater than or
equal to two: if it does not, you have an old VESA 1.x driver that
will not support any of the functions described in this document.</p>

<p> VBE 2.0 provides a new bank switching mechanism that can be used
in a protected mode environment without the expensive switch to real
mode. This is implemented as a small stub of relocatable 32 bit code
provided by the VESA driver, which can be copied into your address
space and then called directly to perform the bank switch, hardware
scrolling, and palette setting functions. It is very easy to add
support for this method into an existing body of VESA 1.x code, and
the speed improvement can be dramatic.</p>

<p> The 32 bit code stubs are obtained by calling VESA function
0x4F0A, for example:</p>

<pre>   typedef struct VESA_PM_INFO
   {
      unsigned short setWindow            __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short setDisplayStart      __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short setPalette           __attribute__ ((packed));
      unsigned short IOPrivInfo           __attribute__ ((packed));
   } VESA_PM_INFO;


   VESA_PM_INFO *vesa_pm_info;

   void *pm_bank_switcher;


   int get_vesa_pm_functions()
   {
      __dpmi_regs r;

      /* check that the driver is at least VBE version 2.0 */
      if (vesa_info.VESAVersion &lt; 0x200) 
	 return -1;

      /* call the VESA function */
      r.x.ax = 0x4F0A;
      r.x.bx = 0;
      __dpmi_int(0x10, &amp;r);
      if (r.h.ah)
	 return -1;

      /* allocate space for the code stubs */
      vesa_pm_info = malloc(r.x.cx);

      /* copy the code into our address space */
      dosmemget(r.x.es*16+r.x.di, r.x.cx, vesa_pm_info);

      /* store a pointer to the bank switch routine */
      pm_bank_switcher = (void *)((char *)vesa_pm_info + 
				  vesa_pm_info-&gt;setWindow);

      return 0;
   }
</pre>

<p>This code will give you a pointer to the protected mode bank
switching function, but you cannot call this directly from C because
it uses a special register based argument passing convention. A little
bit of inline asm is needed to make sure the parameters go into the
correct registers, eg:</p>

<pre>   void set_vesa_bank_pm(int bank_number)
   {
      asm (
	 " call *%0 "
      :                             /* no outputs */

      : "r" (pm_bank_switcher),     /* function pointer in any register */
	"b" (0),                    /* set %ebx to zero */
	"d" (bank_number)           /* bank number in %edx */

      : "%eax",                     /* clobber list (we have no way of */
	"%ebx",                     /* knowing which registers the VESA */
	"%ecx",                     /* code is going to change, so we */
	"%edx",                     /* have to assume the worst and list */
	"%esi",                     /* them all here) */
	"%edi"
      );
   }
</pre>

<p>This routine is an exact drop-in replacement for the
<tt>set_vesa_bank()</tt> function described in the previous chapter,
but will run several hundred times faster!</p>

<p> VBE 2.0 also provides the ability to use a linear framebuffer mode
in which the entire video memory can accessed as a single block at
some location other than the standard 0xA0000, which gets rid of the
need for bank switching altogether. This is both the fastest and the
easiest way to program SVGA graphics, but unfortunately you can't
count on it being supported by all hardware. Even if the card has a
VBE 2.0 driver, many older boards don't support linear framebuffers at
all, and a few of the more recent ones can only use linear addressing
in certain resolutions.</p>

<p> Setting a linear framebuffer mode is extremely simple. After
calling the <tt>find_vesa_mode()</tt> function, check that bit 7 of
<tt>mode_info.ModeAttributes</tt> is set, to make sure that linear
addressing is possible in this mode. Assuming that it is supported,
when you call function 0x4F02 to select the mode you should put
<tt>(mode_number | 0x4000)</tt> into the BX register, instead of just
<tt>mode_number</tt>, and you will have a linear framebuffer!</p>

<p> The video memory is located at the physical address specified by
the <tt>mode_info.PhysBasePtr</tt> field, but you must map this area
into your address space before you can access it. This can be done
with the code:</p>

<pre>   __dpmi_meminfo mapping;
   int selector;

   /* map into linear memory */
   mapping.address = mode_info.PhysBasePtr;
   mapping.size = vesa_info.TotalMemory &lt;&lt; 16;
   if (__dpmi_physical_address_mapping(&amp;mapping) != 0)
      return -1;

   /* allocate an LDT descriptor to access the linear region */
   selector = __dpmi_allocate_ldt_descriptors(1);
   if (selector &lt; 0) {
      __dpmi_free_physical_address_mapping(&amp;mapping);
      return -1;
   }

   /* set the descriptor location and size */
   __dpmi_set_segment_base_address(selector, mapping.address);
   __dpmi_set_segment_limit(selector, mapping.size-1);
</pre>

<p>You can now write to any part of the screen using the selector that
we just created, and without any need for bank switching, eg:</p>

<pre>   void linear_putpixel(int x, int y, int color)
   {
      _farpokeb(selector, y*640+x, color);
   }
</pre>

<p>Finally, at the end of your program you should free the video
memory mapping with the code:</p>

<pre>   __dpmi_free_physical_address_mapping(&amp;mapping);
   __dpmi_free_ldt_descriptor(selector);
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to use the "Fat DS" trick from
<tt>&lt;sys/nearptr.h&gt;</tt> to access the framebuffer directly with
a normal C pointer. This is a very appealing technique because it
allows you to treat the entire SVGA screen exactly like a normal C
array, but you should be aware that it won't work under some DPMI
hosts (notably Windows NT and Linux DOSEMU), plus if you write all
your code in this way it will be difficult to later add support for
banked SVGA modes in case you ever need to make your program run on
hardware without a linear framebuffer. But if you are happy to
restrict yourself to systems that are capable of linear addressing and
support the Fat DS method, you can set this up with the code:</p>

<pre>   #include &lt;sys/nearptr.h&gt;

   __dpmi_meminfo mapping;

   if (!__djgpp_nearptr_enable())
      return -1;

   /* map into linear memory */
   mapping.address = mode_info.PhysBasePtr;
   mapping.size = vesa_info.TotalMemory &lt;&lt; 16;
   if (__dpmi_physical_address_mapping(&amp;mapping) != 0)
      return -1;
</pre>

<p>Drawing a pixel is now just a matter of getting a pointer to the
video memory by adding the framebuffer address onto the
<tt>__djgpp_conventional_base</tt> value, and then using array syntax
to access individual pixels, eg:</p>

<pre>   void nearptr_linear_putpixel(int x, int y, int color)
   {
      char *video = (char *)(mapping.address + __djgpp_conventional_base);
      video[y*640+x] = color;
   }
</pre>

<p>Before you exit from a program that uses the nearptr system, you
should call the functions:</p>

<pre>   __dpmi_free_physical_address_mapping(&amp;mapping);
   __djgpp_nearptr_disable(); 
</pre>
